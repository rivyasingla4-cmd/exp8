# AIM
To study and implement the for loop in Python by performing operations such as number printing, summation, matrix display, matrix multiplication, prime number generation, and pattern printing.
# THEORY

A for loop in Python is used to repeat a block of statements for a fixed number of iterations. It is commonly used when the number of repetitions is known in advance.
The for loop works by iterating over a sequence. In most programs, the range function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. During each iteration, the loop variable takes the next value from the sequence and executes the loop body.
Nested for loops are used when one loop is placed inside another. They are useful for working with matrices and generating patterns.
The for loop improves program readability and is widely used for counting, traversal, mathematical computation, and structured repetition.

# algorithm
# PROGRAM 1
Print numbers from 1 to 5
Step 1 Start

Step 2 Use for loop with range from 1 to 6

Step 3 Assign value to loop variable

Step 4 Print the value

Step 5 Repeat steps 3 and 4 until range ends

Step 6 Stop

# PROGRAM 2
Print odd numbers between 1 and 10
Step 1 Start

Step 2 Use for loop with range starting from 1 ending at 11 with step 2

Step 3 Assign value to loop variable

Step 4 Print the value

Step 5 Repeat steps 3 and 4 until range completes

Step 6 Stop

# PROGRAM 3
Find sum of first N natural numbers

Step 1 Start

Step 2 Read value of N from user

Step 3 Initialize total as 0

Step 4 Use for loop from 1 to N

Step 5 Add current number to total

Step 6 Display running sum

Step 7 Repeat steps 5 and 6 until loop ends

Step 8 Stop
# PROGRAM 4
Display elements of a 3 by 3 matrix
Step 1 Start

Step 2 Define matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns

Step 3 Use outer loop to select each row

Step 4 Use inner loop to select each column

Step 5 Print matrix element

Step 6 After completing one row move to next line

Step 7 Repeat steps 3 to 6 until all rows are printed

Step 8 Stop
# PROGRAM 5
Multiply two 3 by 3 matrices

Step 1 Start

Step 2 Define matrix A

Step 3 Define matrix B

Step 4 Initialize result matrix with zeros

Step 5 Use outer loop to select row of A

Step 6 Use second loop to select column of B

Step 7 Initialize result element to zero

Step 8 Use third loop to multiply corresponding elements

Step 9 Add product to result position

Step 10 Repeat multiplication for all positions

Step 11 Display result matrix

Step 12 Stop
# PROGRAM 6
Print prime numbers in a given range
Step 1 Start

Step 2 Select number from range 2 to 50

Step 3 Assume number is prime

Step 4 Check divisibility from 2 to number minus 1

Step 5 If divisible mark number not prime and stop checking

Step 6 If number remains prime print number

Step 7 Repeat steps 2 to 6 for all numbers

Step 8 Stop

# PROGRAM 7
Print inverted star pattern

Step 1 Start

Step 2 Initialize starting value as 10

Step 3 Use for loop decreasing from 10 to 1

Step 4 Print star pattern based on loop value

Step 5 Move to next line

Step 6 Repeat steps 4 and 5 until loop ends

Step 7 Stop

# PROGRAM 8
Print pyramid pattern

Step 1 Start

Step 2 Set number of rows

Step 3 Use loop from 1 to number of rows

Step 4 Print spaces for alignment

Step 5 Print stars based on row number

Step 6 Move to next line

Step 7 Repeat steps 4 to 6 until rows complete

Step 8 Stop

# PROGRAM 9
Nested loop pattern
Step 1 Start

Step 2 Read value of n

Step 3 Use loop from 0 to n minus 1

Step 4 Print spaces based on loop value

Step 5 Print stars based on remaining value

Step 6 Move to next line

Step 7 Repeat steps 4 to 6 until loop ends

Step 8 Stop

# CONCLUSION
The for loop provides an efficient method for performing repeated execution when the number of iterations is known. Through these programs, different applications of for loops such as counting, summation, matrix processing, prime number detection, and pattern generation were implemented successfully. Nested loops were used for matrix operations and pattern printing. This experiment improves understanding of iteration control and strengthens programming logic in Python.
